# cms-claims-data-pipeline
**CMS DE-SynPUF Project: Schema design, SQL queries, and source-to-target mapping**

This project simulates a simplified data pipeline for CMS synthetic outpatient claims data. It demonstrates key data processing concepts relevant to data analyst and data engineering workflows. It includes:

- A small subset of outpatient claim fields from the 2008â€“2010 CMS DE-SynPUF public dataset
- A raw SQL table matching the original source structure
- A cleaned table with renamed, business-friendly column names
- Source-to-target mapping documentation for field transformations
- SQL scripts for schema creation and sample analysis

The goal is to showcase SQL proficiency, schema design, and an understanding of data pipeline structure in a healthcare claims context.
